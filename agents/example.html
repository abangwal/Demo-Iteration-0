        <h1>AeroVironment</h1>
          <p><strong>Description :</strong> AeroVironment is a company with a 50-year history of developing advanced, agile, and effective technological innovations. The company specializes in unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), loitering munition systems, unmanned ground vehicles, and high-altitude pseudo-satellites for military applications. One of their popular UAS products is the Raven B RQ-11, which is ideal for low-altitude intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. It has a wingspan of 4.5 feet, weighs 4.4 pounds, and can provide aerial observation during day and night with a line-of-sight range of 10 kilometers. AeroVironment also offers the Mantis i23 gimbaled EO/IR camera designed for use with the Raven UAS to provide real-time color or infrared imagery to ground control remote viewing stations. Their Tomahawk Ground Control Stations (GCS) are user-friendly systems that serve as common control units for warfighters while providing AI-enhanced capabilities for seamless integration with human-machine teams across tactical networks.</p>
          <p><strong>Timeline:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            
              <li>{Year/Month} - AeroVironment made a strategic decision to sell its Efficient Energy Systems (EES) division to Webasto for $35 million, allowing it to focus on its drone business and become a pure-play drone company.</li>
            
              <li>{Year/Quarter 1} - AeroVironment reported highly impressive growth in its fiscal first-quarter financial results: revenue soared 127% to $78 million, net income came in at $27.3 million (reversing a year-ago loss), and adjusted earnings per share were $0.85 (crushing expectations of $0.30).</li>
            
              <li>{Year/Quarter 1} - Product sales nearly tripled year-over-year and contract services rose 45%, contributing to the strong financial performance.</li>
            
              <li>{Year/Quarter 1} - Gross margin improved dramatically by 17 percentage points to 42%, due largely to a favorable mix of product-related revenue.</li>

              <li>{Year/Quarter 1} - The company effectively controlled costs with minimal gains in key items such as research and development spending and overhead expenses.</li>
            
              <li>{Year/Quarter 1} - CEO Wahid Nawabi expressed optimism about the future, highlighting how divestiture of the EES business transformed AeroVironment into a future-defining technology solution provider serving large and growing global defense, telecommunications, and commercial markets.</li>
            
              <li>{Year/Ongoing} - AeroVironment has made progress on its HAPSMobile global broadband communications project with SoftBank for providing internet access using high-altitude solar-powered drones.</li>
            
              <li>{Year/Ongoing} - AeroVironment holds a 5% stake in HAPSMobile with an option to increase it up to 19%.</li>
